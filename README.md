# Mortgage Calculator

A simple web-based **Mortgage Calculator** application that calculates the final interest amount based on user inputs. Users can input details like the **Principal Amount**, **Annual Interest Rate**, and **Term (in years)**, and the application calculates and displays the interest amount as the output. 

This project uses **Spring Web** to handle the backend logic and **Thymeleaf** as the templating engine to render HTML pages.

## Features

- Input fields for **Principal Amount**, **Annual Interest Rate**, and **Loan Term** (in years)
- Calculation of the total interest amount based on user input
- Real-time display of the calculated results on a simple and intuitive web interface
- Built with **Spring Boot**, **Spring Web**, and **Thymeleaf**

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Web**
- **Thymeleaf** (Template Engine)
- **HTML/CSS** (for front-end)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 11 or higher
- **Maven** (for managing dependencies)

## Usage

1. Enter the **Principal Amount** (e.g., $100,000).
2. Enter the **Annual Interest Rate** (e.g., 5%).
3. Enter the **Loan Term** (e.g., 15 years).
4. Click **Calculate**.
5. View the final interest amount displayed as the result.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java` - Contains the main Java files for Spring Boot and backend logic
- `src/main/resources/templates` - Contains Thymeleaf templates for the HTML pages
- `src/main/resources/static` - Stores static assets (e.g., CSS)
- `application.properties` - Configuration file for Spring Boot

## Example Calculation

For a **Principal Amount** of $100,000, an **Annual Interest Rate** of 5%, and a **Term** of 15 years, the calculator will output the total interest payable over the loan period.
